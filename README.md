Another change

Returns a JSON representation of the object. If the object has a
[`toJSON`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#toJSON()_behavior)
function, it **will not be called**.

> **NOTE** The method will return an empty JSON if the referenced object is not stringifiable. It will throw an error if the object has circular references.

This is another line I believe will help us see what the problem is.
