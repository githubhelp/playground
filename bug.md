### Question Regarding Pull Requests

1. Developer 1 submits pull request from GitHub client.
2. Code Reviewer closes pull request with feedback.
3. Developer 1 updates code, commits, in GitHub client.
4. Developer 1 clicks on pull request button (which has number of pull request that was closed next to it).

*The web page opens up showing the existing closed pull request. I <strong>expect</strong> to see a new pull request dialog within GitHub Desktop*
